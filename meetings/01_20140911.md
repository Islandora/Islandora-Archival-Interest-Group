###Notes:

#####Introductions (name, affiliation, interest in this group):
*	They happened. And it was great. Hello world!
*	Interests include: how archives are using Islandora; how it compares to other options for archival management activities; integration with existing access systems; development of modules; etc. 

#####Terms of Reference:
*	Link here: https://github.com/Islandora/Islandora-Archival-Interest-Group
*	Originally derived from other interest group terms
*	Going to adapt original statement so that notetaker can be a rotating task
*	After the meeting, Sara Allain will make a report for the Roadmap Committee
*	There are more people in the group now than are on the list; Sara will update
*	Call for initial feedback or changes:
    *	Request to change "supplementary technologies" so as not to downplay relevance of other systems. Will change to "other technologies".

#####Meeting schedule/note-takers:
*	Have participants from North American west coast all the way to the the British Isles (_edited by Sara, who originally said "the UK" when referring to Ireland - sorry, Caleb!_)
*	This time (12pm EST) is likely the best time for us to continue to meet
*	Would be good to set standard meeting time, so a Doodle poll is not necessary every time
*	Proposal: Thursdays at 12pm EST, once a month (3rd Thursday of the month)
    *	Most people suggest that this time works (via IM)
    *	Sara will send out an email with this proposal to confirm
    *	Sara will also send out a Note-takers list proposal
*	Co-conveners welcome! Let Sara know if you would like to co-convene

#####Roadmap for the IG:

*More to come*
